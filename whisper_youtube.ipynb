        "# Whisper's transcription plus Pyannote's Diarization \n",
        "\n",
        "Andrej Karpathy [suggested](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1574476200801538048?s=20&t=s5IMMXOYjBI6-91dib6w8g) training a classifier on top of  OpenAI [Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/) model features to identify the speaker, so we can visualize the speaker in the transcript. But, as [pointed out](https://twitter.com/tarantulae/status/1574493613362388992?s=20&t=s5IMMXOYjBI6-91dib6w8g) by Christian Perone, it seems that features from whisper wouldn't be that great for speaker recognition as its main objective is basically to ignore speaker differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following, I use [**`pyannote-audio`**](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio), a speaker diarization toolkit by Hervé Bredin, to identify the speakers, and then match it with the transcriptions of Whispr. I do it on the first 30 minutes of  Lex's 2nd [interview](https://youtu.be/SGzMElJ11Cc) with Yann LeCun. Check the result [**here**](https://majdoddin.github.io/lexicap.html). \n",
        "\n",
        "To make it easier to match the transcriptions to diarizations by speaker change, Sarah Kaiser [suggested](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/264#discussioncomment-3825375) runnnig the pyannote.audio first and  then just running whisper on the split-by-speaker chunks. \n",
        "For sake of performance (and transcription quality?), we attach the audio segements into a single audio file with a silent spacer as a seperator, and run whisper on it. Enjoy it!"

            "[05:28.420 --> 05:29.680]  destination.\n",
            "[05:29.680 --> 05:32.640]  That's basically the summary of what he says about that.\n",
            "[05:32.640 --> 05:33.640]  And then...\n",
            "[05:33.640 --> 05:40.160]  I'm sorry, I'm laughing because I just opened 17 and turned and it's like, across from him\n",
            "[05:40.160 --> 05:45.080]  sat the vast abhorrence of the Judge, half naked, scribbling in his ledger.\n",
            "[05:45.080 --> 05:51.700]  He's constantly naked too, but that just like the abhorrence of the Judge.\n",
            "[05:51.700 --> 05:54.520]  We haven't even mentioned that he's a murderous pedophile, but...\n",
            "[05:54.520 --> 06:01.560]  I was going to point to exactly that part because it's the setup for the section that\n",
            "[06:01.560 --> 06:03.760]  Wes is pointing us to.\n",
            "[06:03.760 --> 06:07.160]  They're sitting around the fire and yeah, it begins with the vast abhorrence of the\n",
            "[06:07.160 --> 06:08.160]  Judge.\n",
            "[06:08.160 --> 06:10.160]  To me, that's the beginning of the section.\n",
            "[06:10.160 --> 06:14.640]  Yeah, because there's kind of two campfire scenes in this chapter.\n",
            "[06:14.640 --> 06:19.480]  And the one that I just talked about with the world as a fever dream is the first one.\n",
            "[06:19.480 --> 06:22.360]  And the second one is the war is God part.\n",
            "[06:22.360 --> 06:26.680]  So I forget where the abhorrence thing is.\n",
            "[06:26.680 --> 06:34.320]  It's on page 243 in this version of the book.\n",
            "[06:34.320 --> 06:37.240]  So let's give a little bit of this argument.\n",
            "[06:37.240 --> 06:42.160]  Basically Jackson has said something about living by the sword, dying by the sword.\n",
            "[06:42.160 --> 06:47.960]  The rare moment where someone in the book is moralistic about the violence.\n",
            "[06:47.960 --> 06:52.320]  And the Judge is basically going to say something like, war is actually the telos of man.\n",
            "[06:52.320 --> 06:54.440]  It's kind of his built-in end.\n",
            "[06:54.440 --> 06:58.080]  So he'll say, it makes no difference what men think of war, said the Judge.\n",
            "[06:58.080 --> 06:59.300]  War endures.\n",
            "[06:59.300 --> 07:02.400]  As well ask men what they think of stone.\n",
            "[07:02.400 --> 07:03.840]  War was always there.\n",
            "[07:03.840 --> 07:06.360]  Before man was, war waited for him.\n",
            "[07:06.360 --> 07:09.800]  The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner.\n",
            "[07:09.800 --> 07:11.920]  That is the way it was and will be.\n",
            "[07:11.920 --> 07:14.200]  That way and not some other way.\n",
            "[07:14.200 --> 07:16.520]  And then he kind of teases Brown.\n",
            "[07:16.520 --> 07:18.960]  It's your trade we honor here, mine too.\n",
            "[07:18.960 --> 07:21.400]  And Brown's like, what's with all the notebooks then?\n",
            "[07:21.400 --> 07:25.320]  Why are you sketching and being a botanist and being a geologist and all that?\n",
            "[07:25.320 --> 07:29.560]  He'll say all other trades are contained in that of war.\n",
            "[07:29.560 --> 07:35.560]  And then he'll say war endures because young men love it and old men love it in them.\n",
            "[07:35.560 --> 07:38.960]  Rare moment in them.\n",
            "[07:38.960 --> 07:42.320]  I think that's a great, great line.\n",
            "[07:42.320 --> 07:44.020]  Yeah.\n",
            "[07:44.020 --> 07:47.440]  And then the idea is that, so why is it the telos of man?\n",
            "[07:47.440 --> 07:49.320]  Because man is a creature of play.\n",
            "[07:49.320 --> 07:54.600]  This is the weird inversion of Nietzsche on the aesthetic and on sublimation, right?\n",
            "[07:54.600 --> 07:59.600]  The idea is that yes, men are creatures of play and play is no more than work.\n",
            "[07:59.600 --> 08:02.600]  But the ultimate manifestation is in the game.\n",
            "[08:02.600 --> 08:10.080]  In games, the higher the stakes, the more worth they confer on the participants and\n",
            "[08:10.080 --> 08:13.000]  the more agency to game they confer on participants.\n",
            "[08:13.000 --> 08:16.240]  So he'll say all games aspire to the condition of war.\n",
            "[08:16.240 --> 08:20.360]  For here, that which is wagered swallows up game, player, all.\n",
            "[08:20.360 --> 08:21.360]  We should read that paragraph.\n",
            "[08:21.360 --> 08:27.640]  Yeah, why don't you do that?\n",
            "[08:27.640 --> 08:29.940]  Men are born for games, nothing else.\n",
            "[08:29.940 --> 08:32.440]  Every child knows that play is nobler than work.\n",
            "[08:32.440 --> 08:37.120]  He knows too that the worth or merit of a game is not inherent in the game itself, but\n",
            "[08:37.120 --> 08:40.600]  rather in the value of that which is put at hazard.\n",
            "[08:40.600 --> 08:43.960]  Games of chance require a wager to have meaning at all.\n",
            "[08:43.960 --> 08:48.000]  Games of sport involve the skill and strength of the opponents and the humiliation of defeat\n",
            "[08:48.000 --> 08:52.240]  and the pride of victory are in themselves sufficient stake because they inhere in the\n",
            "[08:52.240 --> 08:54.560]  worth of the principles and define them.\n",
            "[08:54.560 --> 08:59.400]  But trial of chance or trial of worth, all games aspire to the condition of war.\n",
            "[08:59.400 --> 09:03.760]  For here, that which is wagered swallows up game, player, all.\n",
            "[09:03.760 --> 09:07.240]  Suppose two men at cards with nothing to wager save their lives.\n",
            "[09:07.240 --> 09:08.800]  Who has not heard of such a tale?\n",
            "[09:08.800 --> 09:10.200]  A turn of the card?\n",
            "[09:10.200 --> 09:14.720]  The whole universe for such a player has labored clanking to this moment, which will tell if\n",
            "[09:14.720 --> 09:18.100]  he is to die at the man's hand or that man at his.\n",
            "[09:18.100 --> 09:21.480]  What more certain validation of a man's worth could there be?\n",
            "[09:21.480 --> 09:26.200]  This enhancement of the game to its ultimate state admits no argument concerning the notion\n",
            "[09:26.200 --> 09:27.200]  of fate.\n",
            "[09:27.200 --> 09:31.840]  The selection of one man over another is a preference absolute and irrevocable, and it\n",
            "[09:31.840 --> 09:36.800]  is a dull man indeed who could reckon so profound a decision without agency or significance,\n",
            "[09:36.800 --> 09:37.880]  either one.\n",
            "[09:37.880 --> 09:42.240]  In such games as have for their stake the annihilation of the defeated, the decisions\n",
            "[09:42.240 --> 09:43.420]  are quite clear.\n",
            "[09:43.420 --> 09:48.040]  This man holding this particular arrangement of cards in his hand is thereby removed from\n",
            "[09:48.040 --> 09:49.040]  existence.\n",
            "[09:49.040 --> 09:54.040]  This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the game and the authority and the\n",
            "[09:54.040 --> 09:55.640]  justification.\n",
            "[09:55.640 --> 09:58.840]  Seen so, war is the truest form of divination.\n",
            "[09:58.840 --> 10:05.760]  It is the testing of one's will and the will of another within that larger will which,\n",
            "[10:05.760 --> 10:09.400]  because it binds them, is therefore forced to select.\n",
            "[10:09.400 --> 10:16.320]  War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence.\n",
            "[10:16.320 --> 10:20.200]  War is God.\n",
            "[10:20.200 --> 10:26.400]  The interesting idea here is that we think of the unifying force in the world as love\n",
            "[10:26.400 --> 10:29.280]  or natural equivalent of that, right?\n",
            "[10:29.280 --> 10:31.000]  Natural forces that bind.\n",
            "[10:31.000 --> 10:32.000]  Bring things together.\n",
            "[10:32.000 --> 10:34.280]  Yeah, bring things together, unify and synthesize.\n",
            "[10:34.280 --> 10:38.000]  But here, the idea is that war does that.\n",
            "[10:38.000 --> 10:45.920]  It's not mere annihilation because it involves this contest of wills that binds two wills\n",
            "[10:45.920 --> 10:47.280]  to a larger will.\n",
            "[10:47.280 --> 10:50.240]  This also sounds kind of Schopenhauerian in a way.\n",
            "[10:50.240 --> 10:54.040]  You know, it's almost like an anti-Hegel type of thesis.\n",
            "[10:54.040 --> 10:57.960]  You know, he's anti-Nietzschean, he's anti-Hegel in that the master-slave dynamic.\n",
            "[10:57.960 --> 11:02.800]  It's not that mutual reciprocity, right, in which there's some level of equality reached\n",
            "[11:02.800 --> 11:09.920]  between the two participants and their mutual recognition kind of parallel to a planetary\n",
            "[11:09.920 --> 11:12.120]  orbit that doesn't swallow up the planet.\n",
            "[11:12.120 --> 11:17.640]  Rather, this is sort of the theory of the master, which is that you simply overpower\n",
            "[11:17.640 --> 11:20.400]  the slave and that's the unity, right?\n",
            "[11:20.400 --> 11:24.020]  You get a unification of the self through that overpowering.\n",
            "[11:24.020 --> 11:28.880]  But the one other thing I want to say about this is that the idea of the game here is\n",
            "[11:28.880 --> 11:33.040]  that when you're playing a game, you know, if you think of the world in a deterministic\n",
            "[11:33.040 --> 11:37.080]  way, everything that's happened is the result of the causal matrix in which you exist.\n",
            "[11:37.080 --> 11:42.240]  All the previous things that have happened in the world come to that point and it's predetermined\n",
            "[11:42.240 --> 11:43.920]  in some sense.\n",
            "[11:43.920 --> 11:46.680]  And the game player embraces that moment.\n",
            "[11:46.680 --> 11:49.240]  They say, okay, I'm going to play a game of luck.\n",
            "[11:49.240 --> 11:51.560]  In No Country for Old Men, right, it's just the flipping of the coin.\n",
            "[11:51.560 --> 11:53.160]  It's kind of a pure version of that.\n",
            "[11:53.160 --> 11:57.760]  I'm going to play a game of luck in which the stakes are ultimate and I'm going to kind\n",
            "[11:57.760 --> 12:07.440]  of retrieve agency out of determinism by making the decision to go along with the determinism,\n",
            "[12:07.440 --> 12:11.080]  you know, whatever deterministic or chance result comes.\n",
            "[12:11.080 --> 12:15.280]  And not only that, I'm going to stake my life on that.\n",
            "[12:15.280 --> 12:20.200]  I'm going to make this appeal to what the judge calls the historical absolute.\n",
            "[12:20.200 --> 12:25.600]  This is why violence is taken to be the road to agency is because in being violent and\n",
            "[12:25.600 --> 12:30.400]  getting into a contest of wills which is violent and playing a game for the ultimate stakes,\n",
            "[12:30.400 --> 12:38.400]  I am willfully subjecting myself to the outcome of that battle even though in some sense it's\n",
            "[12:38.400 --> 12:42.600]  predetermined probably by just who's bigger, who has more force, right, but also by a lot\n",
            "[12:42.600 --> 12:49.000]  of other preceding causal forces.\n",
            "[12:49.000 --> 12:53.440]  So I'm sure that as Dylan was reading it, all the folks listening jumped out of their\n",
            "[12:53.440 --> 12:58.520]  chairs to make the connection to No Country for Old Men with Anton Chigurh and the flipping\n",
            "[12:58.520 --> 13:05.760]  of the coin, right, because he essentially is the embodiment of this thesis in that context.\n",
            "[13:05.760 --> 13:07.160]  A couple of things I want to say about this.\n",
            "[13:07.160 --> 13:13.440]  So first off, I caution the listener against the concept here of he's talking about war\n",
            "[13:13.440 --> 13:19.880]  because he's not talking about war in the sense of nation against nation or army against\n",
            "[13:19.880 --> 13:20.880]  army.\n",
            "[13:20.880 --> 13:23.000]  That's not the way he's characterizing it.\n",
            "[13:23.000 --> 13:27.120]  He's talking about it's the state of nature, right, the war of all against all.\n",
            "[13:27.120 --> 13:29.120]  It's got more of that kind of a flavor.\n",
            "[13:29.120 --> 13:35.360]  And he talks about the war consuming the players and the game.\n",
            "[13:35.360 --> 13:38.820]  And the reason why it's important to talk about the two individuals testing their wills\n",
            "[13:38.820 --> 13:43.800]  against each other as part of the larger will is that when one is destroyed, there's no\n",
            "[13:43.800 --> 13:45.320]  more game.\n",
            "[13:45.320 --> 13:51.160]  If we play chess and Dylan beats me, the game still exists, I still exist, and we can play\n",
            "[13:51.160 --> 13:53.960]  another game or somebody else can play chess.\n",
            "[13:53.960 --> 14:03.920]  It's that war constitutes an irreducible and unique particular event.\n",
            "[14:03.920 --> 14:08.520]  Like the normal stakes of a game, what's at stake, he says, the humiliation of defeat\n",
            "[14:08.520 --> 14:09.680]  and the pride in victory, right?\n",
            "[14:09.680 --> 14:13.240]  And you can get that out of a game of like hearts or pinnacle or whatever.\n",
            "[14:13.240 --> 14:16.660]  Silliest game, Monopoly, we can feel, we get some of that.\n",
            "[14:16.660 --> 14:18.360]  And so something's at stake.\n",
            "[14:18.360 --> 14:23.560]  And the question is, the game becomes better and better the more you raise the stakes.\n",
            "[14:23.560 --> 14:27.720]  So if you raise it to the level of life and death, then you've enhanced the game.\n",
            "[14:27.720 --> 14:33.160]  And so this is all about the validation of the worth of the participant, right?\n",
            "[14:33.160 --> 14:37.840]  The pride in victory, this is how you endow yourself with worth and agency.\n",
            "[14:37.840 --> 14:43.880]  And the only way to maximize that is to take the ultimate risk of death and engage in this\n",
            "[14:43.880 --> 14:46.480]  violent struggle.\n",
            "[14:46.480 --> 14:48.840]  Annihilation must be the stake.\n",
            "[14:48.840 --> 14:51.360]  Yeah.\n",
            "[14:51.360 --> 14:57.300]  Annihilation is the stake, but the vindication or what you get at, it's not just survival,\n",
            "[14:57.300 --> 15:00.880]  but it's the extinction of somebody else's existence, right?\n",
            "[15:00.880 --> 15:08.240]  So it's a combination of wagering, but also winning that wager in the form of, like if\n",
            "[15:08.240 --> 15:13.480]  I was going to tie this back to, for example, Heidegger, gratuitous name drop, I apologize\n",
            "[15:13.480 --> 15:15.640]  for violating the rule.\n",
            "[15:15.640 --> 15:19.280]  But the notion that death is the end of possibility, right?\n",
