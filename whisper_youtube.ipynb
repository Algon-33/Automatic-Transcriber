        "# Whisper's transcription plus Pyannote's Diarization \n",
        "\n",
        "Andrej Karpathy [suggested](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1574476200801538048?s=20&t=s5IMMXOYjBI6-91dib6w8g) training a classifier on top of  OpenAI [Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/) model features to identify the speaker, so we can visualize the speaker in the transcript. But, as [pointed out](https://twitter.com/tarantulae/status/1574493613362388992?s=20&t=s5IMMXOYjBI6-91dib6w8g) by Christian Perone, it seems that features from whisper wouldn't be that great for speaker recognition as its main objective is basically to ignore speaker differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following, I use [**`pyannote-audio`**](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio), a speaker diarization toolkit by Herv√© Bredin, to identify the speakers, and then match it with the transcriptions of Whispr. I do it on the first 30 minutes of  Lex's 2nd [interview](https://youtu.be/SGzMElJ11Cc) with Yann LeCun. Check the result [**here**](https://majdoddin.github.io/lexicap.html). \n",
        "\n",
        "To make it easier to match the transcriptions to diarizations by speaker change, Sarah Kaiser [suggested](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/264#discussioncomment-3825375) runnnig the pyannote.audio first and  then just running whisper on the split-by-speaker chunks. \n",
        "For sake of performance (and transcription quality?), we attach the audio segements into a single audio file with a silent spacer as a seperator, and run whisper on it. Enjoy it!"

            "[05:18.960 --> 05:23.440]  There's kind of two campfire scenes in this chapter. And the one that I just talked about\n",

            "[05:56.880 --> 06:04.000]  of war, said the judge. War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always there.\n",

            "[09:00.000 --> 09:07.200]  because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is God.\n",
            "[09:07.200 --> 09:14.160]  The interesting idea here is that we think of the unifying force in the world as love or\n",

            "[09:25.280 --> 09:34.160]  not mere annihilation, because it involves this contest of wills that binds two wills to a larger\n",
            "[09:34.160 --> 09:40.720]  will. This also sounds kind of Schopenhauerian in a way. It's almost like an anti-Hegel type of\n",

            "[09:58.640 --> 10:05.120]  planet. Rather, this is sort of the theory of the master, which is that you simply overpower the\n",
            "[10:05.120 --> 10:11.120]  slave. And that's the unity, right? You get a unification of the self through that overpowering.\n",
            "[10:11.120 --> 10:16.880]  But the one other thing I want to say about this is that the idea of the game here is that when\n",

            "[10:37.280 --> 10:40.720]  right? It's just the flipping of the coin. It's kind of a pure version of that. I'm going to play\n",
            "[10:40.720 --> 10:47.840]  a game of luck in which the stakes are ultimate. And I'm going to kind of retrieve agency out of\n",
            "[10:47.840 --> 10:55.920]  determinism by making the decision to go along with the term determinism, whatever deterministic\n",
            "[10:55.920 --> 11:03.280]  or chance result comes. And not only that, I'm going to stake my life on that. I'm going to\n",

            "[11:14.000 --> 11:21.600]  wills which is violent and playing a game for the ultimate stakes, I am willfully subjecting myself\n",
            "[11:21.600 --> 11:27.040]  to the outcome of that battle, even though in some sense it's predetermined, probably by just\n",
            "[11:27.040 --> 11:31.440]  who's bigger, who has more force, right? But also by a lot of other preceding causal forces.\n",
            "[11:32.080 --> 11:37.440]  So I'm sure that as Dylan was reading it, all the folks listening jumped out of their chairs to make\n",
            "[11:37.440 --> 11:42.320]  the connection to No Country for Old Men with Anton Chigurh and the flipping of the coin,\n",
            "[11:42.960 --> 11:49.520]  right? Because he essentially is the embodiment of this thesis in that context. A couple of things I\n",
            "[11:49.520 --> 11:55.040]  want to say about this. So first off, I caution the listener against the concept here of he's\n",
            "[11:55.040 --> 12:02.640]  talking about war, because he's not talking about war in the sense of nation against nation or army\n",
            "[12:02.640 --> 12:07.520]  against army. That's not the way he's characterizing it. He's talking about it's the state\n",
            "[12:07.520 --> 12:13.520]  of nature, right? The war of all against all. It's got more of that kind of a flavor. And he talks\n",
            "[12:13.520 --> 12:19.840]  about the war consuming the players and the game. And the reason why it's important to talk about\n",
            "[12:19.840 --> 12:24.640]  the two individuals testing their wills against each other as part of the larger will is that\n",
            "[12:24.640 --> 12:30.560]  when one is destroyed, there's no more game. Like if we play chess and Dylan beats me,\n",
            "[12:30.560 --> 12:36.320]  the game still exists, I still exist, and we can play another game or somebody else can play chess.\n",
            "[12:36.880 --> 12:44.880]  It's that war constitutes an irreducible and unique particular event.\n",
            "[12:44.880 --> 12:49.120]  Like the normal stakes of a game, what's at stake, he says? The humiliation of defeat\n",
            "[12:49.680 --> 12:53.040]  and the pride in victory, right? And you can get that out of a game of hearts or\n",
            "[12:53.040 --> 12:58.480]  pinochle or whatever. Silliest game, Monopoly. We can feel, we get some of that. And so something's\n",
            "[12:58.480 --> 13:04.560]  at stake. And the question is, the game becomes better and better the more you raise the stake.\n",
            "[13:04.560 --> 13:09.040]  So if you raise it to the level of life and death, then you've enhanced the game. And so\n",
            "[13:09.600 --> 13:15.600]  this is all about the validation of the worth of the participant, right? The pride in victory,\n",
            "[13:15.600 --> 13:21.120]  this is how you endow yourself with worth and agency. And the only way to maximize that is to\n",
            "[13:21.760 --> 13:28.080]  take the ultimate risk of death and engage in this violent struggle. Annihilation must be\n",
            "[13:28.080 --> 13:35.840]  the stake. Yeah. Annihilation is the stake, but the vindication or what you get at, it's not just\n",
            "[13:35.840 --> 13:41.920]  survival, but it's the extinction of somebody else's existence, right? So it's a combination\n",
            "[13:42.640 --> 13:49.840]  of wagering, but also winning that wager in the form of, like if I was going to tie this back to,\n",
            "[13:49.840 --> 13:55.040]  for example, Heidegger, gratuitous name drop, I apologize for violating the rule.\n",
            "[13:55.040 --> 14:00.320]  But the notion that death is the end of possibility, right? Death represents\n",
            "[14:00.320 --> 14:05.920]  Daseins not having any future projection anymore possibility. It's the snuffing out,\n",
            "[14:05.920 --> 14:11.680]  essentially, of a world, right? There's an old Jewish thing. Basically, the idea is that if you\n",
            "[14:11.680 --> 14:18.720]  take a life, it's as if you had taken an entire world because that person could have children,\n",
            "[14:18.720 --> 14:25.600]  those children have children, you could be cutting off an entire future of people and possibilities\n",
            "[14:25.600 --> 14:30.960]  and worlds. And I think that's part of this as well. So the judge doesn't characterize it this\n",
            "[14:30.960 --> 14:35.840]  way, because if you think about it in the descriptions of the violence that they perpetrate,\n",
            "[14:35.840 --> 14:40.320]  which by the way, I'm trying to recall if we ever have any explicit descriptions of the kid\n",
            "[14:40.320 --> 14:45.840]  actually perpetrating any of the atrocities the way some of the others do, but it's oftentimes,\n",
            "[14:45.840 --> 14:51.280]  it seems as though they're not actually risking. In some cases they are, but when they slaughter\n",
            "[14:51.280 --> 14:56.960]  the peaceful Indians in their village, there's no real risk to them. And so there's kind of a\n",
            "[14:56.960 --> 15:01.440]  betrayal of this notion, the judge is speaking out of two sides of his mouth. Now, you could\n",
            "[15:01.440 --> 15:06.240]  say that that's not the judge, that's Glanton, that's doing that and what have you. But there's\n",
            "[15:06.240 --> 15:11.680]  something specious about this characterization that doesn't sit with me. I mean, they do get\n",
            "[15:11.680 --> 15:18.720]  messed up pretty badly by Apaches and by General Elias's men. They can, there are situations where\n",
            "[15:18.720 --> 15:22.800]  they're testing their will against the others in the ultimate game and there are others where they're\n",
            "[15:22.800 --> 15:28.400]  not. That's not war. What I'm saying is they're not at war all the time in this book. They're\n",
            "[15:28.400 --> 15:33.600]  perpetrating massacres. Yeah, I think you're right that Holden is what he means by war is rather\n",
            "[15:33.600 --> 15:38.560]  expansive and war of all against all and it can be a massacre. It could just be completely\n",
            "[15:38.560 --> 15:43.520]  overpowering your quote unquote enemy or which could be a child, right? He's killing children\n",
            "[15:43.520 --> 15:48.720]  as well and being a pedophile and yeah. I mean, even though there's a condition of\n",
            "[15:49.360 --> 15:55.360]  one against the other, it seems to me that it's in his characterization, it's all about\n",
            "[15:56.160 --> 16:03.920]  the hazard of you yourself. And I think it's right. This isn't geopolitical confrontation\n",
            "[16:03.920 --> 16:11.920]  kind of war. This is a one individual against other individuals or circumstances in which you\n",
            "[16:12.640 --> 16:19.040]  push your own existence. The stakes of moment after moment are your own existence itself and\n",
            "[16:19.040 --> 16:27.440]  the part that would link up with other people is your annihilation of another is only more\n",
            "[16:27.440 --> 16:33.520]  validation of your winning. It's not glory exactly. That's not what's won, right? But it is\n",
            "[16:33.520 --> 16:40.560]  it's agency and autonomy. I think it's agency and autonomy and your killing of other people is a\n",
            "[16:41.120 --> 16:46.000]  activity of your agency and autonomy. It's important to mention that because there are\n",
            "[16:46.000 --> 16:51.280]  ways that you could risk your life without confronting somebody else where they would\n",
            "[16:51.280 --> 16:57.360]  be risking theirs in the same endeavor. Like you can do extreme stunts or climb mountains or do\n",
            "[16:57.360 --> 17:02.160]  you know and that's not what he's talking about. I wondered about that a little bit with asking\n",
            "[17:02.160 --> 17:07.200]  the question about nature. So you raised the question of like free solo. You're going to go\n",

            "[17:12.720 --> 17:21.040]  Alex Panol did and extraordinarily risky for most people, arguably very risky even for someone like\n",
            "[17:21.040 --> 17:28.320]  him. And part of that free solo and part of the deal is the stakes. It's clearly part of the deal\n",

            "[30:44.080 --> 30:50.800]  nations to intersect in such a horrible way. So the binding thing is history and deterministic\n",
            "[30:50.800 --> 30:59.200]  forces. That's how we can be united in a violent interaction. So it's sick, obviously, but that's\n",
            "[30:59.200 --> 31:05.680]  the theory. I agree. I'm just trying to understand its self-consistency. In the case of the universe\n",
            "[31:05.680 --> 31:11.600]  being a contest of wills, it's important, I think, to remember that those wills aren't necessarily\n",
            "[31:11.600 --> 31:17.600]  embodied by individuals. I mean, that's just a distinction almost without a difference,\n",
            "[31:17.600 --> 31:22.720]  I think, for Holden. Well, the larger will is certainly not. Yeah. And then I think you're\n",
            "[31:22.720 --> 31:26.720]  putting the question again of whether it can be man against nature, a struggle against\n",
            "[31:26.720 --> 31:30.800]  a war in the sense of a struggle against natural forces of the desert or something like that,\n",
            "[31:30.800 --> 31:37.120]  which‚Ä¶ Yes. And this is where, is it going too far to say it's a destiny as history,\n",
            "[31:37.840 --> 31:46.320]  and it's sort of your mere existence when having continually put your own existence to hazard,\n",
            "[31:46.320 --> 31:54.000]  that is the pinnacle of agency. And all those other forces that you've put yourself to a hazard\n",
            "[31:54.000 --> 31:59.920]  and that the will would be the thing that you are hazarding against, the will of the universe in a\n",
            "[31:59.920 --> 32:06.000]  myriad possible manifestations, but that's what it means to be. You and your own will have put\n",
            "[32:06.000 --> 32:13.840]  yourself to a hazard and that act of risk is manifest in being against another will, in the\n",
            "[32:13.840 --> 32:19.280]  wind of some other will. In chapter 12, when the judge‚Ä¶ What's the beef between the judge and the\n",
            "[32:19.280 --> 32:26.720]  kid? The judge suspects that the kid is appealing to the moral law instead of the law of history,\n",
            "[32:26.720 --> 32:31.760]  right? So, he will say‚Ä¶ Chapter 12 or‚Ä¶ Chapter 12, when the judge visits him in jail,\n",
            "[32:31.760 --> 32:36.160]  and this is after‚Ä¶ In jails, the first time the kid gets a bit vocal and starts talking about,\n",
            "[32:36.960 --> 32:42.400]  in a remorseful way to the jailers, I think, about what he's been involved in. And then the judge\n",
            "[32:42.400 --> 32:47.520]  will say things like, you alone shaped events on their calamitous course. You sat in judgment of\n",
            "[32:47.520 --> 32:53.040]  your own deeds. You put your own allowances before the judgments of history, right? Which is moral\n",
            "[32:53.040 --> 32:58.240]  reasoning type allowances. And therefore, you poison the enterprise. You dishonored war. War\n",
            "[32:58.240 --> 33:02.400]  is actually holy. War should have been the God that you were worshipping. And instead, you\n",
            "[33:02.400 --> 33:08.240]  went with morality. That's ultimately why it seems‚Ä¶ It's a little unclear in the end if he\n",
            "[33:08.240 --> 33:13.040]  kills a kid, but it seems that he does. That's his beef with the kid. He'll say at the end in\n",
            "[33:13.040 --> 33:17.280]  Griffin as well, war is dishonored when its nobility is called into question. You become\n",
            "[33:17.280 --> 33:23.360]  a false dancer and this and that. So, the important, I think, point to take out of all of that,\n",
            "[33:23.360 --> 33:28.960]  there's an implication in all this that goal-directed behavior is always heteronomy.\n",
            "[33:28.960 --> 33:34.160]  So, for instance, if you are a traditional moralist, you might say, well, being subject to\n",
            "[33:34.160 --> 33:39.920]  my desires and to objects and that's an unfreedom. But if I can reason and be responsive to other\n",
            "[33:39.920 --> 33:46.400]  goals, higher goals, then there's freedom in that. And the judge's point is that any goal-directed\n",
            "[33:46.400 --> 33:55.040]  behavior is subjection unless the goal is submission to the judgments of history, submission to\n",
            "[33:55.840 --> 33:59.600]  destiny. That's sort of the significance of the epilogue at the very end of the book\n",
            "[33:59.600 --> 34:04.400]  where the drilling of these holes, I think, seems less like the pursuit of some continuance than the\n",
            "[34:04.400 --> 34:09.920]  verification of a principle, a validation of a sequence, and causality as if each round perfect\n",
            "[34:09.920 --> 34:15.440]  hole owed its existence to the one before it. So, Kantian idea is that autonomy through\n",
            "[34:16.320 --> 34:25.040]  an internally issued law, here it's autonomy through behavior that is not goal-directed at all\n",
            "[34:25.040 --> 34:31.120]  except insofar as its obedience to causal principles of history, let's put it that way.\n",
            "[34:31.120 --> 34:34.800]  I wanted to evaluate Judge Holden a little bit on this.\n",
            "[34:34.800 --> 34:36.000]  Is he a good philosopher?\n",
            "[34:37.120 --> 34:41.360]  There's two things that come to mind. One is to continue to pursue this question of the role of\n",
            "[34:41.360 --> 34:49.520]  the other in our becoming full realizations of ourselves, okay, which to me, that's absent for\n",
            "[34:49.520 --> 34:56.560]  him. But the other one is just evaluating his own actions in the context of this war. Let's just\n",
            "[34:56.560 --> 35:02.800]  take the example where he picks up the child, travels around with the child on his horse for a\n",
            "[35:02.800 --> 35:06.480]  while until later he kills the child and scalps it, right?\n",
            "[35:06.480 --> 35:09.920]  And this is like the lone survivor of a village that they've massacred, this child.\n",
            "[35:09.920 --> 35:16.640]  Yes, the lone survivor of a village that he's massacred. He basically picks up this kid as a\n",
            "[35:16.640 --> 35:24.560]  kind of trophy along the way. There's a sense in which there's a kind of sick notion that he's\n",
            "[35:24.560 --> 35:30.640]  preserved this child from the massacre, but only to kill the child later on purpose.\n",
            "[35:30.640 --> 35:35.920]  How is that a contest of wills? That is an example, and it seems to me Holden has numerous\n",
            "[35:35.920 --> 35:44.480]  examples. It isn't putting himself to a hazard. It is just gratuitous domination and wanton\n",
            "[35:44.480 --> 35:51.520]  violent domination, which isn't the same thing as putting yourself to risk and surviving the risk,\n",
            "[35:51.520 --> 35:53.120]  surviving the hazard.\n",
            "[35:53.120 --> 36:00.400]  He's suzeraining the earth, stuffing birds, killing birds, stuffing them, that which exists\n",
            "[36:00.400 --> 36:04.640]  without my knowledge exists without my consent, sketching things and then destroying them or\n",
            "[36:04.640 --> 36:05.760]  scratching them out.\n",
            "[36:05.760 --> 36:10.240]  That's the tension that I'm wondering about is that the piece we've focused on for the past 45\n",
            "[36:10.240 --> 36:16.640]  minutes, that seems to be one pole of his philosophy regarding the state of war. But the\n",
            "[36:16.640 --> 36:22.960]  notion that nothing exists in the world unless I understand it and I comprehend it and I destroy\n",
            "[36:22.960 --> 36:28.080]  it. I mean, he has this scene where he goes and he gathers all these things, he draws them out in\n",
            "[36:28.080 --> 36:34.080]  his book, and then he goes and he burns all the artifacts themselves. That's his act of consuming\n",
            "[36:34.080 --> 36:41.120]  the world into his own, his suzeraining it. To me, those two things are like separate philosophies\n",
            "[36:41.120 --> 36:46.160]  and there's a tension between them. It feels like, not that Judge Holden has any, you know,\n",
            "[36:46.160 --> 36:51.840]  he has to be consistent. I mean, it seems to me that he's kind of fooling himself about the way\n",
            "[36:51.840 --> 36:56.400]  in which he presents his romantization of the world as war.\n",
            "[36:56.400 --> 37:00.560]  Well, that was kind of what I was driving at earlier when I was saying that he's speaking out\n",
            "[37:00.560 --> 37:06.080]  of two sides of his mouth. But I don't think the two things are inconsistent. As long as you continue\n",
            "[37:06.080 --> 37:11.600]  to do that, it doesn't obviate that you can do despicable and especially if you think that there's\n",
            "[37:11.600 --> 37:16.800]  no morality, then it's irrelevant. Well, we can go back to that, but I do think that they are\n",
            "[37:16.800 --> 37:22.080]  inconsistent with one another. What I wanted to say was, because I think we got to kind of\n",
            "[37:22.080 --> 37:27.600]  get towards the end anyway, is that the suggestion is, it's not just the suggestion,\n",
            "[37:27.600 --> 37:32.240]  it becomes clearer. But in retrospect, all of these conversations, all these discourses that\n",
            "[37:32.240 --> 37:36.720]  the judge is doing are for the sake of the kid. Because he doesn't care about the other people,\n",
            "[37:36.720 --> 37:40.560]  they're either fully in or they're like the ex-priests, they're irredeemable from his\n",
            "[37:40.560 --> 37:45.440]  perspective. The kid is the one, he's trying to figure out, you know, the kid is like Job or\n",
            "[37:45.440 --> 37:52.000]  something, right? Where he's like, he's trying to convert him. And I think that the judge keeps\n",
            "[37:52.000 --> 37:55.680]  goading him and saying that he never fully committed, he doesn't understand the philosophy\n",
            "[37:55.680 --> 38:02.320]  of violence and war, that what the judge wants is for the kid to kill him or try to kill him anyway.\n",
            "[38:02.320 --> 38:06.880]  And there is that moment, I think it's in the penultimate chapter or the chapter before that,\n",
            "[38:06.880 --> 38:12.160]  where the kid and the priest are in the desert and the judge walks by and the priest keeps telling\n",
            "[38:12.160 --> 38:16.960]  him, you've got to do this, this is your chance, you know, this is... And the judge says, I've\n",
            "[38:16.960 --> 38:20.560]  walked by you twice and I'm going to walk by you again. A third time.\n",
            "[38:20.560 --> 38:25.840]  A third time. You do not have it in you, you cannot do this. But it's as if he's setting the\n",
            "[38:25.840 --> 38:33.760]  stage. So, ultimately, the judge is wagering in a very real way, his existence. And because\n",
            "[38:33.760 --> 38:39.680]  he's winning by not annihilating in some sense his opponent, although we know he eventually does,\n",
            "[38:39.680 --> 38:46.160]  but it's like he's giving the kid multiple, multiple chances to validate his thesis and to\n",
            "[38:46.160 --> 38:53.120]  fully become an autonomous individual. And then after, you know, what is it, the kid's 16 when\n",
            "[38:53.120 --> 38:58.160]  the whole thing ends and he's 28, I think, when they meet in Griffin. So, it's been 12 years.\n",
            "[38:58.160 --> 39:04.480]  And mind you, right before he goes to Griffin, the kid kills a child, a 15-year-old at the\n",
            "[39:04.480 --> 39:09.120]  campfire. I don't know if you remember that. By the way, the child, this is one of the two\n",
            "[39:09.120 --> 39:14.480]  brothers whose grandfather was the guy they tell the story about. Well, the child can...\n",
            "[39:14.480 --> 39:21.520]  In all fairness. Yeah. It doesn't matter. It's a test of wills. He went to war and he tested his\n",
            "[39:21.520 --> 39:25.680]  will. And he, of course, he did it by hiding out because he knew the kid was going to come back\n",
            "[39:25.680 --> 39:30.240]  and try to kill him. He tries to hide from the kid, the kid comes, yeah. Well, and by the way,\n",
            "[39:30.240 --> 39:38.400]  talk about those two kids being the grandchildren of a guy, a traveler, who was murdered and buried\n",
            "[39:38.400 --> 39:43.520]  in the road. And do you remember them telling the story of the old man who's the blacksmith\n",
            "[39:43.520 --> 39:47.040]  or whatever? The judge tells the story, the harnesser. The judge tells the story. The\n",
            "[39:47.040 --> 39:51.680]  harness maker. Harness maker, yeah. So, the implication is that these two kids are the\n",
            "[39:51.680 --> 39:55.760]  grandchildren of that guy who got murdered, the one who gets killed by the harness maker.\n",
            "[39:55.760 --> 40:00.960]  To wrap us up for today. Okay. So, maybe we could talk about that in the third part. Because the\n",
            "[40:00.960 --> 40:06.560]  theme is the frozen, what does the judge call it? The point of that harness maker story is to say\n",
            "[40:07.200 --> 40:12.720]  that there's a concept, and the book begins with this, of violent regression based on an idealized\n",
            "[40:12.720 --> 40:19.600]  father figure that has simply disappeared from one's life. The frozen god of the father or\n",
            "[40:19.600 --> 40:25.760]  something like that. And Holden, at the end, tells the kid, you could have been my son.\n",
            "[40:26.720 --> 40:31.200]  Yeah. We should probably talk about the. The jakes. The dancing bear. Which is bizarre,\n",
            "[40:31.200 --> 40:36.400]  bizarre and incomprehensible. Oh, and the dancing of Judge Holden. The dancing bear,\n",
            "[40:36.400 --> 40:42.080]  and then Judge Holden takes over. The pigs, oh, the pigs, yeah, so it all comes full circle,\n",
            "[40:42.080 --> 40:46.560]  right? So, you have the dancing bear in the saloon who gets shot by the.\n",
            "[40:46.560 --> 40:53.120]  Someone. By somebody after the bear's owner tries to ask him for money. We have the previous bear\n",
            "[40:53.120 --> 40:57.920]  that has pig eyes, and the judge having pig eyes. And then the judge has the conversation with the\n",
            "[40:57.920 --> 41:04.160]  kid, who's now the man, although not capitalized at the way the kid is, K and kid is. The kid goes\n",
            "[41:04.160 --> 41:09.760]  to go to the bathroom in the outhouse, and the judge is inside when he opens the door,\n",
            "[41:09.760 --> 41:16.560]  naked. Bear hugs him and locks the door behind him. And all you get after that is just two men,\n",
            "[41:16.560 --> 41:21.760]  I think, who look in and are dumbfounded to the point where they can't even describe or what it's,\n",
            "[41:21.760 --> 41:27.440]  what the scene is in there. It ends with the judge on the dance floor, dancing naked,\n",
            "[41:28.400 --> 41:34.560]  like the bear twirling around. It is bizarre. He never sleeps, he says. He says he'll never die.\n",
            "[41:34.560 --> 41:39.520]  He never sleeps, the judge. He is dancing, dancing. He says that he will never die.\n",
            "[41:39.520 --> 41:47.120]  The weirdest paragraph is the last one. It's sing-songy, like into a fade into a fever dream.\n",
            "[41:47.120 --> 41:51.280]  Yes. It's different than everything that comes before. It's in present tense. There's a few\n",
            "[41:51.280 --> 41:56.320]  places where the book does go in the present tense in an odd way from past tense, but this is the\n",
            "[41:56.320 --> 42:02.720]  most prominent one, as if now we are talking about a force of nature and a principle and something\n",
            "[42:02.720 --> 42:08.960]  that does exist forever and is not to be referred to as something that has passed. This is something\n",
            "[42:08.960 --> 42:14.240]  he's doing forever. He bows to the fiddlers and he does this, he does that. This is eternal,\n",
            "[42:14.240 --> 42:21.280]  this dance. This unity aspect that we were talking about does get articulated again as\n",
            "[42:21.280 --> 42:30.320]  a ritual of letting of blood, which is also related to this gaming and orchestration of events.\n",
            "[42:30.320 --> 42:36.800]  So, he's talking with the kid, and this is where not having quotation marks sometimes get in the\n",
            "[42:36.800 --> 42:42.320]  way. The man seeks his own destiny. Yeah. Let me put it this way, said the judge. If it is so that\n",
            "[42:42.320 --> 42:47.760]  they themselves have no reason and yet are indeed here, must they not be here by reason of some\n",
            "[42:47.760 --> 42:54.640]  other? And if this is so, can you guess what that other might be? No. Can you? I know him well. He\n",
            "[42:54.640 --> 42:58.720]  poured the tumbler full once more and he took a drink himself from the bottle and wiped his mouth\n",
            "[42:58.720 --> 43:04.400]  and turned to regard the room. This is an orchestration for an event, for a dance in fact.\n",
            "[43:04.400 --> 43:09.360]  The participants will be apprised for their roles at the proper time. For now it is enough that they\n",

            "[43:52.800 --> 43:57.440]  narrator's saying that part. Yeah, it does. And initially when I read this book, I thought,\n",
            "[43:57.440 --> 44:02.080]  first of all, Judge Holden is all over the fucking place. This is like someone's trying to graft\n",
            "[44:02.080 --> 44:06.000]  something philosophical onto this. I have much more appreciation. I think there is a\n",
            "[44:06.000 --> 44:10.800]  more consistency and it's a very philosophically interesting idea that the judge actually has.\n",
            "[44:10.800 --> 44:18.560]  And then at this point, this is often the mark of a bad piece of writing when the author inserts\n",
            "[44:18.560 --> 44:25.040]  their own commentary on their work into the mouth of a character, in my opinion. In this case,\n",
            "[44:25.040 --> 44:29.840]  I don't think so. I mean, I think it's fine. But because it's part of the point that the judge is\n",
            "[44:29.840 --> 44:35.120]  trying to make, I mean, everything is a narrative for him, right? And it's orchestrated, it's a\n",
            "[44:35.120 --> 44:41.120]  historical, it's predestined, it's a product of historical forces. And so it's not surprising that\n",
            "[44:41.120 --> 44:45.600]  he sees it through that lens and sounds like the narrator at that point. You were bringing up the\n",
            "[44:45.600 --> 44:51.440]  ritual and the bloodletting for a reason, I thought. Yeah. So this is Holden continuing.\n",
            "[44:51.440 --> 44:55.680]  A ceremony then. One could well argue that there are not categories of no ceremony,\n",
            "[44:55.680 --> 45:00.560]  but only ceremonies of greater or lesser degree. And deferring to this argument, we will say that\n",
            "[45:00.560 --> 45:06.080]  this is a ceremony of a certain magnitude, perhaps more commonly called a ritual. A ritual includes\n",
            "[45:06.080 --> 45:12.400]  the letting of blood. Rituals which fail in this requirement are but mock rituals. Here every man\n",
            "[45:12.400 --> 45:17.200]  knows the false at once. Never doubt it. That feeling in the breast that evokes a child's\n",

            "[45:27.760 --> 45:33.520]  Don't look away. We are not speaking in mysteries. You of all men are no stranger to that feeling,\n",

            "[45:45.840 --> 45:52.080]  man? Of whom do we speak when we speak of a man who was and is not? Are these blind riddles,\n",
            "[45:52.640 --> 45:58.080]  or are they not some part of every man's jurisdiction? What is death if not an agency,\n",
            "[45:58.640 --> 46:04.000]  and whom does he intend toward? Look at me. Look at me. I don't like craziness.\n",
            "[46:04.000 --> 46:13.360]  Says the kid. Nor I, nor I. Bear with me. The next, yeah. Does he say that? Yeah. Oh,\n",
            "[46:13.360 --> 46:19.120]  it's hilarious. The next part, which I won't try to read because I know we're running out of time,\n",

            "[46:25.680 --> 46:31.040]  want to overpower other people, that it's all about power. Yeah. So that consistency is there.\n",
            "[46:31.040 --> 46:36.000]  Yeah. It's about power. Yep. And it's Thrasymachus. And then ultimately he comes to this idea,\n",
            "[46:36.000 --> 46:41.040]  you know, man seeks his own destiny and no other. Said the judge, will or nil, any man who could\n",

            "[46:56.240 --> 47:02.240]  trying to retrieve out of that as the endorsement of destiny and subjection of oneself to the\n",
            "[47:02.240 --> 47:07.360]  highest stakes in relation to destiny, which is death, the possibility of death. I haven't myself\n",
            "[47:07.360 --> 47:12.880]  given thought to the dancing bear and the dancing of judge and the dancing of the judge. I mean,\n",
            "[47:12.880 --> 47:18.800]  the dance is, there was a blood letting and a ritual letting of blood and something terrible\n",
            "[47:18.800 --> 47:23.680]  happens to the kid. We assume the dance is understandable in the sense, right? The dance\n",
            "[47:23.680 --> 47:29.360]  is orchestrated. It's when you dance in the way, if you are dancing an orchestrated dance,\n",
            "[47:29.360 --> 47:36.000]  you're doing moves that other people have defined for you. There's a great moment in the movie,\n",
            "[47:36.000 --> 47:41.680]  Ex Machina, where the creator of the intelligent robots, they're able to dance, but they're all\n",
            "[47:41.680 --> 47:46.720]  dancing in concert with him according to his will. So it's a sign of autonomy in a sense,\n",
            "[47:46.720 --> 47:52.000]  right? And the sign of artificial intelligence, but as creator, he can't but help choreograph\n",
            "[47:52.000 --> 47:56.560]  their dance to be exactly what he's doing. But anyway, so the dance is something in which you\n",
            "[47:56.560 --> 48:02.400]  can express yourself and it feels like autonomy and feels like agency in that expressive moment,\n",
            "[48:02.400 --> 48:08.640]  but you are, if it's choreographed, you are simply going through moves defined by others.\n",
            "[48:08.640 --> 48:15.840]  And I think that perfectly represents this theory of agency and the embrace of determinism. So,\n",
            "[48:15.840 --> 48:19.520]  I mean, so that part seems somewhat clear. I just don't, yeah, I haven't figured out\n",
            "[48:19.520 --> 48:23.360]  the poor bear. And then what do we think of the ending?\n",
            "[48:23.360 --> 48:27.440]  I think he's mutilated into a horrible mess in the Jake.\n",
            "[48:27.440 --> 48:33.440]  I agree. I read one commentary, internet commentary, and they were like,\n",
            "[48:34.000 --> 48:40.080]  some people think it was sodomy, but the judge showed no predilection for sexual\n",
            "[48:40.080 --> 48:46.560]  deviation before. I was like, okay, you didn't read the book. But I wouldn't be surprised if\n",
            "[48:46.560 --> 48:50.080]  I wouldn't be surprised if he sodomized him before he killed him. But I have this image\n",
            "[48:50.080 --> 48:56.080]  of the kid upside down, dead with his legs sticking out of the toilet, and out of the,\n",
            "[48:56.080 --> 48:59.200]  what's it, the abattoir or whatever they call that, the hole.\n",
            "[48:59.200 --> 49:03.520]  And at this point he's in his 40s, right? So he's not an abattoir is a slaughterhouse.\n",
            "[49:03.520 --> 49:05.600]  Sorry, that's not what I meant to say. I meant to say.\n",
            "[49:05.600 --> 49:10.160]  So, I mean, it would be an interesting confluence of terms in this case.\n",
            "[49:10.160 --> 49:13.120]  No, the kid's 26, 28, something like that.\n",
            "[49:13.120 --> 49:14.080]  28, yeah.\n",
            "[49:14.080 --> 49:15.920]  No, in the end, he's in his 40s actually.\n",
            "[49:15.920 --> 49:16.560]  What?\n",
            "[49:16.560 --> 49:17.040]  Yeah.\n",
            "[49:17.040 --> 49:17.920]  Really?\n",
            "[49:17.920 --> 49:21.600]  Yeah, because there's a montage and then it gives you a date.\n",
            "[49:21.600 --> 49:25.200]  No, I thought the montage was that he was 28. I would have sworn that.\n",
            "[49:25.200 --> 49:28.800]  He is 28 at a certain point and then you get another fast forward.\n",
            "[49:28.800 --> 49:31.840]  So he meets the judge again after 25 years?\n",
            "[49:32.640 --> 49:36.320]  Yes. There are decades of him having different trades.\n",
            "[49:36.320 --> 49:40.880]  I didn't realize that. I really thought it was just 12 years, but okay, I'm not gonna.\n",
            "[49:40.880 --> 49:43.360]  You know, maybe I'm wrong. You guys can correct. I don't think we need to.\n",
            "[49:43.360 --> 49:45.200]  Well, we can sort that out for the third.\n",
            "[49:45.200 --> 49:48.400]  Yeah. There's plenty more for us to talk about in a third.\n",
            "[49:48.400 --> 49:51.760]  Including this concept of the frozen god of the father,\n",
            "[49:51.760 --> 49:55.360]  the abandoning father of the father who's died too early.\n",
            "[49:55.360 --> 49:55.680]  Yes.\n",
            "[49:55.680 --> 50:00.320]  Things like that because the judge tries to make it speak to what's happening to the Indians.\n",
            "[50:00.320 --> 50:06.480]  And also it speaks to what's happened to the kid and the idea of a regression to violence\n",
            "[50:06.480 --> 50:11.040]  that is based on this condition. The concept of regression actually turns out to be important as\n",
            "[50:11.040 --> 50:11.280]  well.\n",
            "[50:12.160 --> 50:12.800]  Okay.\n",
            "[50:12.800 --> 50:17.520]  So if you're a citizen, you can look forward to listening to part three\n",

            "[50:22.000 --> 50:24.880]  We're going to return to some law and political philosophy.\n",
